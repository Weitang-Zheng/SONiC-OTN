# OTAI Integration to SONiC
## The Issue
[OTAI](../OTAI-v0.0.1.md) defines the APIs for optical vendors to implement SONiC drivers in optical transport devices, a great initiative. The current [implementation](https://github.com/zhengweitang-zwt/OTAI) of OTAI is derived from SAI code base. Although the OTAI APIs are new and independent from SAI, it cloned and modified SAI infrastructure and framework, such as all tool scripts and meta mechanism. This creates a parallel version of code base. As SAI keep involving, adding new features and bug fixes, OTAI would be quickly obsoleted without constantly sync with SAI which is a non-sustainable effort. (SAI has 80+ commit just in the first half of 2023)

Therefore, an alternative design is proposed for a more seamless solution of integrating OTAI into SONiC without carrying the burden of maintaining the SAI infrastructure. 

## SAI experimental extension
While supporting core packet switching features, SONiC also has some build-in extension/customization mechanisms that allows developers to add new or enhance existing features.
SAI extension [Design](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/blob/master/doc/SAI-Extensions.md) goals:
- Support optional and customized SAI attributes object and SAI APIs.
- Allow innovation and experimental features before official inclusion in SAI.
- Experimental extension APIs does not impact existing SONiC systems.

 SAI extension [implementation](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/tree/master/experimental):
- Add new attributes, ex., add new attributes in saiswitchextensions.h.
- Add new API types in saiextension.h.
- Add new object types in saitypesextensions.h
- Can not modify existing SAI.

[DASH](https://github.com/sonic-net/DASH) project recently added new API and objects into SAI experimental extension to support DASH hosts, please see source code [here](https://github.com/opencomputeproject/SAI/tree/master/experimental).

## Dynamically OTAI Extension To SAI 

As described above, DASH extended SAI by adding and modifying the SAI extension files. This approach requires:
- The APIs should be relative mature as large community may start using them;
- Pull request of SAI change needs the SAI team's approval, which may take while.

SAI experimental extension mechanism can be utilized to extend SONiC to support OTN features. However, as OTAI spec is still in its initial stage, so the DASH approach (directly change SAI) may not be efficient at this time. The design objectives of OTAI extension are listed as followings:

- Separated code base from SAI and Keep OTAI as an independent [repo](https://github.com/zhengweitang-zwt/OTAI). 
- Completely reuse and no change to existing SAI code base, including code and tools (ex., meta, parser.pl etc). 
- Based on SAI meta mechanism, OTAI extension is plugged in at compile time:
  - clearly separate OTAI and SAI code base.
  - Without any impact on the existing SONiC platform and SAI spec.
  - No change is needed for existing SAI code base

The following diagram illustrates the OTAI compile time plug in as SAI extension. 
<img src="../../assets/otai-extension.png" alt="SONiC for optical transport white-box system" style="zoom: 50%;">


- A git submodule OTAI [repo](https://github.com/zhengweitang-zwt/OTAI) is added into sonic-sairedis repo.
- At compile time, for any otn platform, ``otaiextension.sh`` script is invoked to extract OTAI APIs and object types from ``otai.h`` and ``otaitypes.h`` and insert them into ``saiextension.h`` and ``saitypesextension.h``.
- For existing switch platform, `otaiextension.sh` will not be called and this change is totally transparent to SONiC packet switching.
- Regular SAI compile then is invoked. As a result, SAI meta data/code generated by ``parser.pl`` would include all API and object type.
  
Note that generated code in meta directory, not the original source code, is used in compile of the rest of software modules (ex.,swss and syncd):
- clear separation of SAI and OTAI code base;
- No SAI changes, header files and perl tools, are required.
- OTAI is a pure add-on at compile time and no duplicated code/tools from SAI. Therefore it is maintenance free and always updated with latest SAI.

As SAI is the center of other modules, swss, syncd and DBs (flexcounter, couter, asic). This provided a potential seamless extension of these modules to support OTN.
